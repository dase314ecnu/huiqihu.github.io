####  Lab Dase-314

I run a small lab studying database and distributed systems. Our research area includes: storage, in-memory and parallel computing,  transaction processing and distributed consensus. In the lab, we prefer study open-sourced systems or open-sourced projects. The students are engaged in research/engineering in systems.

Specifically, my recent interests include:

* distributed storage system, LSM-tree structured storage system with new hardwares (RDMA and NVM)

* cloud-based database, multi-master and shared memory buffer, distributed transaction over database replicas
